# Yappy

Yappy is an [Amplenote plugin](https://www.amplenote.com/help/developing_amplenote_plugins) that implements 
AI functionality wanted by its author. 

Initially, Yappy was developed only within its note in Amplenote, but there were a few benefits to extracting 
it to this git repo:

* When its syntax is incorrect, the IDE can highlight specifically *where* it's wrong
* It can be tested with unit tests
* It will allow GitClear to track how it evolves over time
* It can be used as a template for other Amplenote plugins?

So here we are.

## Installation

Clone this repo. Install node and npm if you haven't already. Run `npm install` to install the packages.
